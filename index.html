                the drink that is made from this plant.

                but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants

                economies of many countries. The first branded

                computer is one the most wonderful inventions
                of modern science. It is fairly a recent invention. 
                It has now become a part and parcel of day-to-day 
                life. The computer was invented by an English 
                mathematician called Charles Babbage. Computers are 
                two basic types: analogue and digital. Analog: 
                computers deal with physical qualities and digital 
                computers deal with numbers. Computers have five major 
                components; input, store, control, processing and output.

                Blog is another word for weblog. 
                A weblog is a website that is like a diary or 
                journal. Most people can create a blog and then 
                write on that blog. Bloggers (a word for people 
                who write on blogs) often write about their opinions 
                and thoughts. A blog containing video material is 
                called a video blog or video log, usually shortened 
                to vlog.
